# Nullsoft Winamp 2000 SP4
This is a Winamp Modern skin which is based on Victhor's [Winamp Classic Modern](https://www.deviantart.com/victhor/art/Winamp-Classic-Modern-by-Victhor-805797724), the "source code" is uploaded to GitHub to easily allow for anyone else to make mods out of this, or to simply help me out on some of the stupid things I haven't yet gotten around to fix or add. :)

If you want to contribute color themes (which is highly encouraged), this guide (soon to be created) will help you through the creation of a new color theme from the ground up.

Don't mind that text file, I've been too lazy to remove it.

If you want to find out who I appreciate the most who have helped me do this thing in my free time, read the [SPECIALTHANKS.MD](https://github.com/The1Freeman/Winamp2000SP4/blob/master/SPECIALTHANKS.md) and check them out as well, they're awesome people in my opinion.

TODO:

 - [x] Add new gammagroups which more or less represent the same colorgroups found within Windows Classic.
 - [x] Themes. (Still in need for some user-made themes)
 - [x] Reduce the hitbox of the window resizers
 - [x] Think about UI consistency
 - [x] Beat Visualizer from Winamp Modern?
 - [x] Just for my own fun/experimentation (and for some more suffering), rebuild the sound recorder from Windows XP
 - [x] A new about window that resembles winver on Windows XP/2000
 - [ ] ~~The same Main Window, but not as big as it is right now~~ Won't work with how Windows Classic does its cool things.
