# Winamp 2000 SP4
This is a Winamp Modern skin which was based on Victhor's [Winamp Classic Modern](https://www.deviantart.com/victhor/art/Winamp-Classic-Modern-by-Victhor-805797724), the "source code" is uploaded to GitHub to easily allow for anyone else to make mods out of this, or to simply help me out on some of the stupid things I haven't yet gotten around to fix or add. :)

Don't mind the two text files, I've been too lazy to remove them.

Changelog is [here](https://github.com/The1Freeman/Winamp2000SP4Issues)

Latest release can be found [here](https://getwacup.com/community/index.php/topic,609.0.html)

TODO:

 - [ ] Add new gammagroups which more or less represent the same colorgroups found within Windows Classic
 - [ ] Themes.
 - [ ] Reduce the hitbox of the window resizers
 - [ ] Think about UI consistency (different text sizes are present for some reason)
