# Winamp 2000 SP4
This is a Winamp Modern skin which was based on Victhor's [Winamp Classic Modern](https://www.deviantart.com/victhor/art/Winamp-Classic-Modern-by-Victhor-805797724), the "source code" is uploaded to GitHub to easily allow for anyone else to make mods out of this, or to simply help me out on some of the stupid things I haven't yet gotten around to fix or add. :)
