This skin is aimed to those who love the simplicity of the classic skin but need to jump to a more high-res-friendly or modern design. All features I could replicate from the classic skin are here, even the loading speed, to certain degree. More than this would have feel bloated and unnecessary, so I left it for another version, a full / more complete one that will be launched later (hopefully this year).

This is a short list of features I think it should contain:

Notification system
Better Albumart Right-click menu ("Search for cover", "Search lyrics", etc)
Menu bar on main player (like Big Bento)
Search in Playlist editor
Merged mode? (an idea of mine)
Secret feature on PL (including embeded album art)
Real-time resize
2 modes timer (mm:ss / hh:mm:ss)
Multi-button bolt
Color themes window
..what else? Any request?
